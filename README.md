# IIT Delhi Research Scientist Assignment Solution

## Problem Statement

Provided a set of floating numbers aᵢ and e, output non-overlapping intervals lᵢ, uᵢ such that:

- All numbers are contained in the interval
- Distance between closer ends of adjacent interval is greater than e ((lᵢ₊₁ - uᵢ)  > e)
- Sum of length of intervals is minimized

## Proposed Solution

- For minimizing sum of length of intervals, the ends should contain numbers which are member of the input set aᵢ. Clearly, all intervals must lie between the minimum value of aᵢ and maximum value of aᵢ.
- Since we have the lower bound and upper bound for required intervals, minimizing the sum of length of intervals is same as maximizing the sum of intervals between these intervals which will not contain any aᵢ provided in the input.

Using these 2 observations, the algorithm using Greedy approach is as follows:

- Sort the input aᵢ
- Start traversing i and when distance between 2 adjacent aᵢ is greater than e, the closing of the current interval is the upper bound of aᵢ₋₁ and the opening of the new interval is the lower bound of aᵢ
- Once the largest aᵢ is reached, close the final interval.

Overall Complexity - O(n log n) due to sorting.

## Input Format

- First line describes number of test cases.
  - First line of each test case contains number of aᵢ
  - Second line contains input for a₁, a₂....
  - Third line contains input for e

## Output Format

- For each test case:
  - First line contains `Intervals for test case <T>:` where T is number of the test case
  - This is followed by k lines where k is number of intervals, containing 2 numbers denoting lower bound and upper bound of the interval
  - Final line contains `Time taken: <TIME> nanoseconds` where TIME is the time of execution in nanoseconds
